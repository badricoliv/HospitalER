# HospitalER
A simulation of a hospital emergency room, that lets patients into the treatment room depending on their urgency

This was a university assignment, so the classes and some of the methods were given to me beforehand

I wrote the methods to reset, run the simulation and report the statistics

The simulator will bring patients into the waiting room, and if there is not enough space in the treatment room they will wait
in the waiting room until they can go into treatment. The patients who are in more urgent need of treatment will be let in before
the patients who are less urgent.
